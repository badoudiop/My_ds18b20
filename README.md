using ds18b20 to get temperature in celsius ; here we display on serial monitor but you dispaly on lcd for example or others .
ds18b20 most easy as ds18s20 : no need of count_per_C or count_remain ;no need of the big formular as in ds18s20 . you need only get 2 bytes and from there get all you need .
there is only one example ; you can create others for the alarm or for using TH and TL .
thanks .
